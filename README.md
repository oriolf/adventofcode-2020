Advent of Code 2020
===================

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code calendar of 2020, implemented in Go.
The initial commit includes the solutions as they where when they passed each 
challenge, without any refactoring or cleanup. I will gradually refactor each day
challenge to shorten and improve the clarity of the code.

The solutions.txt file includes four lines for each day's challenge, the solutions
to the first part with first and second input and to the second part with first and
second input respectfully.

Each problem can be solved using the following command:

    cat inputx | go run main.go y

Where "x" is the input to use (1 or 2) and "y" is the part to solve (1 or 2).

Following are the timings for each problem with the second (submit) input, the 
first part first and then the second. Build times are excluded, but a typical build
takes less than hald a second.
